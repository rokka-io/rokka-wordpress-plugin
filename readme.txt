== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What will happen to my image sizes? =

You can synchronize all defined image sizes as so called stacks to rokka.

= An image from rokka can't be loaded anymore. What should I do? =

If an image which was previously uploaded to rokka can't be loaded anymore try comparing the rokka hash in the WordPress attachment edit screen with the hash of the image on rokka.io ([https://rokka.io/dashboard/](https://rokka.io/dashboard/)) itself.
If it doesn't match anymore just copy & paste the hash from rokka.io to the WordPress attachment edit screen and save the image.

= What is the stack prefix used for? =

When synchronizing image sizes from WordPress to rokka the name of the size will be prefixed with this value to create a new stack on rokka.
By prefixing the rokka stack names we ensure that already existing stacks on rokka won't be overwritten.
Additionally we are able to identify deleted image sizes on WordPress and delete them on rokka as well.

= I created a new / changed an existing size in WordPress. What do I have to do now? =

Everytime you change something on your size configuration in WordPress you need to re-synchronize the sizes with the rokka stacks.
You can do this in the rokka settings (`Settings > Rokka Settings > Sync stacks`).

= Have you found a bug or do you have a feature request? =

Please create a new GitHub issue and let us know: [https://github.com/rokka-io/rokka-wordpress-plugin/issues](https://github.com/rokka-io/rokka-wordpress-plugin/issues)
